"""
'logparser.py' is typically used to process log files and retrieve IP
addresses which can then be considered for filtering using iptables. 
When used without command line options: IP addresses are collected 
from STDIN and reported to STDOUT.

usage:
  logparser.py --help
  logparser.py --version
  logparser.py  [-qvd] 
                [-r | -rr ]
                [--white <wfile>...] 
                [--black <bfile>...] 
                [--input <ifile>...] 
                [--output <ofile>]

Options:
  -h --help  Print the __doc__ string.
  --version  Print the version number.
  -r  How much to report about the IP addresses. 
          0 - just the addresses themselves.
          1 - addresses and number of times each one appeared.
          2 - addresses and number of appearances categorized.
  -d   Demographics: include location/origin of IP if possible.
  -q --quiet  Supress reporting of unexpected conditions.
              Specifically, any input files that either don't exist
              or don't contain any IP addresses.
  -v --verbose  Report any known ('white' or 'black') IPs 
                that have been removed from output.
  -w --white=<wfile>  Specify 0 or more files containing white listed IPs.
  -b --black=<bfile>  Specify 0 or more files containing black listed IPs.
  -i --input=<ifile>  Specify 0 or more input files [default: stdin]
                      If any are provided, stdin is ignored.
                      These are typically log files but don't have to be.
  -o --output=<ofile>  Specify output file.  [default: stdout]
                       If none is provided, output goes to stdout.

Any known IPs can be provided in files specified as containing either
'black' or 'white' listed IPs.  These are also read and any IP addresses 
found will NOT be included in the output.  (See the -v/--verbose option 
which causes this to be reported.) Typically this would be useful if you
have a 'white' list of known IPs you would definitely NOT want to block 
and/or if you had a 'black' list of already blocked IPs which you'd have 
no need to block again.  If you have in fact blocked your black listed
IPs, it should be impossible for any of them to show up in log files.

If any provided file(s) don't exist or don't contain any IP's, this 
will be reported unless the -q/--quiet option is selected.

If this scrolls too much, try piping to pager:
